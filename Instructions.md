# Php_MidtermProject
A Website Midterm Project

Instructions given to us:

A school wants a basic web-based system to manage students and their grades. As a PHP developer, you are tasked with building a simple school management system that can:


Accept student details such as name, age, and grade level.

Manage a list of student scores for different subjects.

Compute the total and average score for a student.

Classify the student’s performance using conditional statements.

Display a list of all students and their computed grades.

Implement loops to process multiple students and subjects efficiently.







A form to input student details (Name, Age, Grade Level).
A form to enter subjects and corresponding scores.
Buttons to submit student data and process grades.







When student data is submitted, it should be stored using arrays or sessions.
The system should calculate the total and average score.
Based on the average score, classify the student's performance:
90-100: Excellent
80-89: Very Good
70-79: Good
60-69: Passed
Below 60: Failed




Display all students with their scores, total, average, and performance classification.



No database should be used; all operations should be handled with PHP arrays or sessions.
Use loops to iterate through student and subject data.
Implement conditional statements to classify performance.
Ensure the interface is user-friendly with structured HTML, CSS, and PHP.



Create an HTML form to input student name, age, and grade level.
Create fields to enter subjects and their respective scores.
Include a submit button to add student records.


Use PHP to store and manage student data in an array or session.
Display the list of added students dynamically.


Implement a function to calculate the total and average score.
Use a loop to iterate through subjects and sum the scores.


Use conditional statements to classify students based on their average scores.
Display the classification along with the student's details.


Show a table with all students, their scores, total, average, and performance.
Ensure proper alignment and readability.

Ensure the PHP, HTML, and CSS code is well-structured and commented.


Implement a simple and clean UI to improve usability.

Add a feature to delete or reset a student’s record from the list.


Submit your complete PHP project as a .zip file.
Include a README file with instructions on how to run the project.
Ensure that your project works on a basic local PHP server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or built-in PHP server).
Submit all files in PDF (screenshot of UI and codes)
